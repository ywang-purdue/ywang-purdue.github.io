					<p>I have been working on the Technology Assistant Dietary Assessment (<b>TADA</b>) project since I joined VIPER. I'm the chief Android developer and associate iOS developer for the TADA mobile applications. My research interest lies in image processing (segmentation, quality enhancement, etc.), pattern recognition and deep learning. </p>
