					<p>I have been working on the Metropolis project at NVIDIA since July 2017. I'm interested in deep learning related computer vision applications as well as natural language processing. I was a Graduate Research Assistant and PhD candidate in the Video and Image Processing Laboratory (<b>VIPER</b>) in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University, under the direction of Professor Edward J. Delp. I received my B.A from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2012.
